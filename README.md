# dom5api

A REST API for the data made available by the excellent [dom5inspector](https://github.com/larzm42/dom5inspector).

This project is in a very early phase. If you'd like some particular endpoint or other feature for whatever project you're working on, please let me know and I'll make sure to prioritise it.
